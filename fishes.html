Unless you have a huge tank with a lot of hiding spaces, do not keep Betta Fishes with other Fishes. Betta Fishes can only be kept together if they are females. Male Bettas will Fight each other and could lead to death. Females on the other hand, could live with each other.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">If you are wondering why "guppies" or "tetras" are not here, it's because those fishes are a bit hard to keep. Sometimes, the other fishes I mentioned are fine with the water but the guppies or tetras could still die due to unknown reasons.
