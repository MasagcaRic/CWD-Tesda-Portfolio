        <h6 class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Placing stylish aquariums inside homes has become a trend, adding incredible ambience to the interiors. Aquariums in various shapes and sizes are available in the market. However, most <br> people do not know how to maintain these aquariums or take care of ornamental fish. Overfeeding or underfeeding the fish is a common mistake that most people make.</h6>

    <h2 class="header blue lighten-3">Acclimate Your Newly Bought Fish</h2>
    <h6 class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">When you are first learning how to acclimate a fish in a new aquarium or bowl, you need to assure a smooth transition to the fish's new home. If done improperly, moving a fish can result in injury or trauma. Make sure you transfer a fish to a new home gradually.
    <br>
    <h3 class="blue lighten-3">
        The most easiest way to acclimate your fish is using the floating method.
    </h3>
    To do this, float the bag in the water for 15-30 minutes. Your fish likely came in a bag from a pet store. If your fish did not come in a bag, you can transfer the fish and water to a small, plastic bag. Tie the end of the bag together and use a rubber band to seal the bag. It's important the bag is sealed tight, as your want your fish to stay in its original water for the initial 15-30 minutes minutes.
    Simply set the bag on top of the water in the quarantine tank. The fish bag should float on the water's surface.
    Set a timer for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the bag during this time to make sure it does not fall over or come undone. For about 15 minutes, allow the bag to float. This way, the water in the bag will gradually become the same temperature as the water in the tank.

        <h2 class="header blue lighten-3">Keep the Tank Size in Mind</h2>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Tank size differs according to the type of fish
        The size of your tank would differ according to the type of fish as different species have different requirements and grow at different paces and into different sizes. You must ensure that there’s enough room for them to grow. Some fish generate a lot of waste and they’re going to need a bigger tank to make up for that. Putting a fish like goldfish or oscar in a small tank would not make sense as their growth will be stunted, and even worse, they may die prematurely. Having a small tank can may result to fluctuations in the water chemistry and lead your fish to death.
        The amount of fish you want to keep is directly proportional to the tank size. Therefore, the more fishes you want to keep the larger your tank should be. Research on the type of fish and the number you want to keep and choose an aquarium tank accordingly.</p>

    <h2 class="header blue lighten-3">Fish Foods And Feeding Time</h2>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">It's important to know what your fish eat in nature and feed accordingly. Are they herbivores, carnivores or omnivores? Most aquarists keep a variety of species in their aquariums, so offering a combination of different foods is best. For example, livebearers are largely herbivores, while tetras are more carnivorous. If you keep both types of fish in your aquarium, as many aquarists do, alternate feedings of meat protein and plant-based foods to keep everyone happy and healthy. Variety is important regardless of what types of fish you keep, as even carnivores benefit from some plant matter in their diet, and vice versa. The size of the food you feed should match the size of your fishes' mouths. In other words, large predatory fish will usually show no interest in small flake crumbles, and small fish like Neon Tetras can't fit large pellets into their mouths. Uneaten food will quickly pollute your aquarium. When feeding frozen foods, dispense food a little at a time using a turkey baster or large syringe to make sure everyone gets some. Drop a little food at the surface for top feeders and gently squirt some lower into the water column for mid-water and bottom feeders. Keep in mind fish should only be fed once per day in order to prevent bladder disease. </p>

    <div class="row container">
        <h1 class="header blue lighten-3">Aeration and Filter</h1>
        <h6 class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">As the temperature of your aquarium increases, the oxygen content in it decreases because the evaporation rate of your tank water will be higher. Therefore, the higher you keep your tank’s temperature, the more aware you need to be of whether or not your fish are getting enough oxygen. Once you get above 800 F, you will probably have to provide some of the aeration devices listed below in addition to your filter.For many aquariums, a simple HOB (hang on back) filter will adequately aerate your tank. Many filters have outputs that drop the water into the surface of the tank and, therefore, provide adequate surface agitation. This surface disturbance increases the surface area in contact with the atmosphere and, therefore, increases oxygen absorption. Additionally, the filter circulates the water in your tank which is important because it moves the water at the bottom of your aquarium (water that is not gaining oxygen from the air) to the top surface so it can increase its oxygen concentration. However, a sponge filter will work just as fine.</h6>

<div class="row container">
    <h2 class="header blue lighten-3">Keep Fish of the Same Size Together</h2>
    <h6 class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Don't put small fishes with big fishes in the same tank. You risk the health of all your small fishes. Not just that, some small fishes do not get along with one another. An example of this is a betta fish or a siamese fighting fish which is an extremely territorial and agressive fish. Betta fish will bully mollies and other small fishes. Even Male Betta Fish attacks Males and Females. Which is why you need to research and pick your fishes. Since not all fish are friendly with each other. <mark class="blue lighten-3">Now, move on to <a href="fishes.html" class="black-text">"Fishes"</a> to see the types of fishes available for a small or beginner aquarium.</mark>
